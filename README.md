This Python project allows users to explore relativistic effects by **choosing between Special Relativity (SR) and General Relativity (GR)**. Depending on the user’s choice, the program computes time dilation, length contraction (SR), or gravitational time dilation (GR) for user-defined velocities, masses, and distances.

## Features
- **Special Relativity (SR):**
  - Computes the Lorentz factor
  - Calculates time dilation:
  - Calculates length contraction:
- **General Relativity (GR):**
  - Computes gravitational time dilation near a massive object
  - Determines how much slower clocks run in a gravitational field
- Interactive input prompts for velocities, masses, distances, proper time, and proper length
- Handles edge cases such as velocity ≥ c or distances ≤ Schwarzschild radius
